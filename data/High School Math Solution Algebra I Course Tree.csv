Students review the definitions of function, domain, and range. Building on their knowledge from Grade 8, they formalize their representations of functions by writing equations in function notation. They use graphical behavior and the structure of the corresponding equations to classify each function according to its function family. The intent of this topic is to introduce these new functions, providing an overview but not a deep understanding at this point.

Students use the linear regression equations to make and assess predictions, and they differentiate between extrapolation and interpolation.

Next, students use correlation coefficients and residual plots to measure the appropriateness of a linear fit. They analyze the formula for the correlation coefficient but use graphing technology to actually calculate the value. They differentiate between correlation and causation, recognizing that a correlation between two quantities does not necessarily mean that there is a causal relationship. Students construct residual plots and use them in conjunction with the shape of the scatter plot and the correlation coefficient to quantify whether a given model is an appropriate fit.

Finally, students are given a scenario and make predictions. They synthesize their learning from the topic to decide whether a linear model is appropriate. They compare the linear model to a quadratic model for the same data and recognize that the quadratic model is the better fit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CO_M02,Topic,CO_M02_T04,Topic 1: Linear Functions,,"Students prove that the common difference of an arithmetic sequence and the slope of the corresponding linear function are both constant and equal. They connect the average rate of change of a linear function to the slope of a line.

Students determine whether functions presented in different forms are linear functions. They explore a scenario represented by equations in three forms: f(x) = ax, f(x) = a(x - c), and f(x) = a(x - c) + d. They compare the graphs to determine what their differences indicate about the functions and the scenarios they model. In addition to graphic transformations, students analyze the structure of each equation.

Students analyze the transformation notation y = A * f(B(x - C)) + D. Formally, they focus only on the effects of replacing A (vertical dilations and/or reflections across the x-axis) and D (vertical translations) with specific values. The topic concludes with students comparing linear functions presented in different forms, including such key characteristics as slopes, y-intercepts, independent and dependent quantities, and appropriate units of measure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using standard form equations builds upon what they learned about standard form in middle school and prepares them to solve systems using the linear combinations method. Students first analyze and solve systems where two equations share a variable whose coefficient in one equation is the additive inverse of its coefficient in the other. They then learn to transform one or both equations to use this method.

Students then consider linear inequalities in two variables. They extend their knowledge of solutions to understand that the solution to an inequality in one variable is half of a number line and the solution to an inequality in two variables is half of a plane. Students then graph two linear inequalities on the same plane and identify the solution set as the intersection of the corresponding half-planes.

Students examine the structure of exponential equations to recognize scenarios in which exponential functions grow or decay by a certain percent. They continue to analyze the structure of exponential graphs as they explore the asymptotes for different functions.

Students use horizontal lines to solve exponential equations for unknown values. They rewrite exponential equations in equivalent forms using the properties of exponents to reveal different characteristics of the quantities defined by the function.

Students solve real-world problems that they can model with exponential functions, including one that requires students to combine function types to best model the scenario.

Initially, students represent data as dot plots, histograms, and box-and-whisker plots—a review from middle school. In addition to creating the data display, students think about when these data displays help represent and compare data sets.

The focus then shifts to how students can describe data sets using shape, center, and spread. They are introduced to a more formal notation to define the formula for mean: x― = Sx _n_ . Students analyze the shape of a data display to determine whether the data set is symmetrical or skewed. They identify outliers and recognize that the mean and IQR are not significantly affected by outliers in a data set.

Students learn the formula for standard deviation and use this measure of spread to describe differences in the data sets. They know when and how to describe a data set with mean and standard deviation vs. median and IQR. Finally, students compare two data sets and make a decision based on the comparison.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

They analyze the data for possible trends or associations. Students then create a marginal frequency distribution and analyze these distributions. They use the frequency distributions to create bar graphs to help visualize the data. Students next learn to display categorical data using a relative frequency distribution and a marginal relative frequency distribution. They then use stacked bar graphs to provide a visual of the relative frequencies.

Conditional relative frequency distributions organize categorical data so that students can determine the percent occurrence of a category given the specific value of another category.

Students examine the characteristics that define a quadratic function and compare different forms to see that the structure of the equation indicates the shape of the graph. They learn to determine whether the graph of a quadratic function opens up or down by inspecting a quadratic function in general or factored form and explore how the axis of symmetry divides a parabola into mirror images. To determine the axis of symmetry of a quadratic equation, students use the zeros of a function (or roots of an equation) or the a and b coefficients of the general form of the equation.

Students transform quadratic functions and learn the vertex form of the quadratic equation based on their understanding of transformations.
